## About me
### At the beginning it was node 

My first deep dive in JavaScript was through nodejs. It was in the times of 
0.4.x. Up to then I only fiddled some jQuery here and there. Not really understood the language.

Then I started to read node.js code samples and not being able to understand anything. 
I started to look for resources and that's how I found Douglas Crockford's talk on JavaScript the good parts. 
That's how it all started.

### Then it came the snake

I mean the Python. Another lovely, powerfull and expressive language.

Anyhow, please look at [my resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h5BDqNI2YrQaCknBqcJMVV_nwj2X7HJF0of0NBzZ1No/edit?usp=sharing) if you will.
