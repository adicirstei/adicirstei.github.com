## How I built a GitHub hosted site - the tools

### [gulpjs](http://gulpjs.com/)
Because I like writing code not configuration files. Let us look at the posts building task:
```js
gulp.task('templates', function () {
  var YOUR_LOCALS = {
    md: marked
  };
    
  gulp.src('src/posts/*.md')
    .pipe(tap(function (file, t) {
      var filename = path.basename(file.path, '.md'),
        contents = file.contents,
        title = contents.toString().split('\n')[0] || filename;
      title = title.replace(/^#*\s*/g, '');
      file.contents = new Buffer('extends layout\nblock content\n  article\n    include:md '
      + path.basename(file.path));
      posts.push({
        file: filename + '.html',
        title: title,
        date: filename.slice(0, 4)
          + '-' + filename.slice(4, 6) 
          + '-' + filename.slice(6, 8)});

    }))
    .pipe(jade({
      locals: YOUR_LOCALS
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./www/posts'));
});
```
What's going on here? I look for any markdown file I find in posts folder and I feed down the pipe a simple jade string that is referencing the blogpost template. Something like this:
```jade
extends layout
  block content
    article
      include:md 20140526001.md
```

The result is a full featured html file. In paralel I build an array with blogpost matadata to feed later to the blog landing page.

### [jade](http://jade-lang.com/)
Because it is briliant for laying out the web page and can be extended with lots of filters of which I used markdown.

### [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)
Markdown looks like the perfect format to write content. It is clean and allows you to extend it. 
I chose marked because it integrates nicely with code highlighting libraries.

### [highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org/)
Because supports tons of languages and tons of themes. Though, in the future, I might consider pygment for the sake of learning.

In order to do the styling at build time you need to define marked's highlight function. 
The `highlight` function I copied from maked [readme page](https://github.com/chjj/marked/blob/master/README.md).
```js
var gulp = require('gulp'),
  jade = require('gulp-jade'),
  marked = require('marked');

marked.setOptions({
  highlight: function (code) {
    return require('highlight.js').highlightAuto(code).value;
  }
});
```
Then, in tasks you require it, you reference it like this:
```js
var YOUR_LOCALS = {
  md: marked
};
```
And somewhere down the line
```js
.pipe(jade({
  locals: YOUR_LOCALS
}))
```
