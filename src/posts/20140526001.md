## How I built it - the tools

### gulpjs
Because I like writing code not configurations. Let us look at the posts building task.....

### jade
Because it is briliant for laying out the web page and can be extended with lots of filters among which I used markdown.

### marked
Markdown looks like the perfect format to write content. It is clean and allows you to extend it. 
I chose marked because it integrates nicely with code highlighting libraries.

### highlight.js
Because supports tons of languages. Though, in the future, I might consider pygment for the sake of learning.

In order to do the styling at build time you need to define marked's highlight function. 

```js
var gulp = require('gulp'),
  jade = require('gulp-jade'),
  marked = require('marked');


marked.setOptions({
  highlight: function (code) {
    return require('highlight.js').highlightAuto(code).value;
  }
});

gulp.task('templates', function () {
  var YOUR_LOCALS = {
    md: marked
  };
    
  gulp.src('src/index.jade')
    .pipe(jade({
      locals: YOUR_LOCALS
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./www'));
});
```
