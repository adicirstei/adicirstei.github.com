## How I buit this GitHub hosted site - theme, posts and SEO

I am not a web designer. I don't have that eye for colors, layout and typoghraphy. I know only some basic CSS. In order to have a decent looking website, I have downloaded a GitHub provided theme and translated it to [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/). This allowed me to reuse the template easily for all may pages.

`layout.jade`
```jade
doctype html
html(lang="en")
  head
.............
    block seo
      title adicirstei home page
      meta(name='description', content='adicirstei home page and blog')
    link(rel='stylesheet', href='/styles/style.css')
.............
body
.............
        section
          block content
.............
```
 
And then, In my post page i just have something like this:
 
```jade
extends layout
block seo
  title the title of my post
  meta(name='description', content='a short description of my post')
block content
  include:md 20140601001.md 
```

But how do I get the blog title, description and file name, you might wonder. This is where the [gulp tap plugin](https://github.com/geejs/gulp-tap) came to the rescue. This simple plugin allows one to 'tap' into the streams of gulp task and take a look at the file contents and name.

```js
gulp.src('src/posts/*.md')
  .pipe(tap(function (file, t) {
    var filename = path.basename(file.path, '.md'),
      contents = file.contents,
      title = contents.toString().split('\n')[0] || filename,
      newfile = filename;
    title = title.replace(/^#*\s*/g, '').trim().replace(/\[([^\]]*)\]\([^)]*\)/g, '$1');
    file.contents = new Buffer("extends layout\nblock seo\n  title adicirstei/blog/" + title +
                               "\n  meta(name='description', content='adicirstei home page and blog and " + title +
                               "')\nblock content\n  article\n    include:md " + path.basename(file.path));
    newfile = title.replace(/(\s|-|_)+/g, '-').toLowerCase();
    file.path = file.path.replace(filename, newfile);
  }))
  .pipe(jade({
    locals: YOUR_LOCALS,
    md: marked
  }))
  .pipe(gulp.dest('./www/posts')); 
```

So, what's going on here? For each `*.md` file I have in posts folder, I peek into the file content, pick the first line strip it off some markdown and use id both as title and description for the `meta` tag. Then I create a new content `Buffer` with the post template and pass it down the pipe to [gulp-jade](https://github.com/phated/gulp-jade) plugin. In order to obtain a SEF url, I also replace the file name with a one creaded based on the post title.

I'm not sure if this is the best approach, but it's getting the job done and that's what mattered for me at the time. My goal was to get up and runnig as fast as possible a web site. And this is what I get.

I hope my sollution to the problem to be of some use for you also.
