## Using syntax highlight at build time

When you build websites with mobile devices in mind you must consider lowering the amount of work you set them do. 
On my ancient iPhone 3G phone I, quite often, encounter web sites that broke the browser. This is because of the
amount of memory they required. When building my statically generated blog, being a programmer, naturally, I considered 
including code snipets in my blog posts as you will see in the current one. Then, having to wait to javascript to 
download and run in order to do the syntax highlighting, it downed on me that I all that parsing and tagging work can be done at build time
and there's no need to do the same work on every device that access my website.

But let's go into the solution. I am writing my blog posts in markdown.
